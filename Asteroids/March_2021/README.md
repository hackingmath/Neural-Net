# Creating an AI to play Asteroids
I created a pygame version of Asteroids, then attempted to use Deep Q Learning to train it.
Install Pytorch and Matplotlib, and Pygame if you're going to use the graphics.
Put game_move.py and dueling_DQN.py in the same directory and run dueling_DQN.py. You'll be 
able to see the ship moving, turning and shooting. Every 10 games it'll print out the 
average scores and at the end of 200 games it'll display a graph of the running average
of the scores of 100 games.
